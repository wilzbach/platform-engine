    """
    A collection for all sentinels, which are used as special line numbers
    during the execution of certain constructs, such as foreach, return, etc.

    How sentinels are used:
    During the flow of execution, they will almost always break
    the normal flow of execution in some manner. For example,
    Lexicon.for_loop calls Stories.execute_block in order to execute the same
    block multiple times. When Stories.execute_block returns the BREAK
    sentinel, Lexicon.for_loop knows that it's time to stop looping.

    Sentinels are used to control the flow of execution. The other approach
    was to start throwing exceptions during execution, but that is a horrible,
    horrible idea because:
    1. Incurs a runtime performance hit
    2. It's an exception, which is not what it was designed to do
